{"name":"Fluent CFD","tagline":"","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\n[ANSYS Fluent](http://www.ansys.com/Products/Simulation+Technology/Fluid+Dynamics/Fluid+Dynamics+Products/ANSYS+Fluent) is a popular engineering computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the interface and modeling through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to CFD, nor is it intended to replace courses such as ME 412 which introduce CFD concepts.\r\n\r\n## Course Notes & Exercises\r\nWe will use the [Etherpad](http://meetingwords.com/ehlagqUook) to share complicated snippets of code and text during class.  The Post-It notes are to indicate either your completion of a task (green) or your need of assistance (pink).\r\n\r\n## First Session (3–4 March)\r\n\r\n## Second Session (10–11 March)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
