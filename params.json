{"name":"Fluent CFD","tagline":"","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\n[ANSYS Fluent](http://www.ansys.com/Products/Simulation+Technology/Fluid+Dynamics/Fluid+Dynamics+Products/ANSYS+Fluent) is a popular engineering computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the interface and modeling through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\n_This course is not an introduction to CFD, nor is it intended to replace courses such as ME 412 which introduce CFD concepts._\r\n\r\n## Access to Fluent\r\nWe will meet in an EWS computer lab which has ANSYS/Fluent installed already.  ANSYS 14.5.7 is available in the Windows labs, while the Linux labs support ANSYS 14.1.1.  You can purchase an academic license for ANSYS from the campus [Webstore](https://webstore.illinois.edu/).\r\n\r\nAccess is also available using the [CITRIX](https://citrix.engr.illinois.edu/) client (14.5.7) or the Linux-based [nxclient](http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/lab-information/remote-connections/using-linux-apps-remotely-x-forwarding).\r\n\r\n## Course Notes & Exercises\r\nDownload the compressed file associated with this web page listed above.\r\n\r\n## Sessions:\r\nFirst Session (19–20 February)\r\n\r\nSecond Session (10–11 March)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
